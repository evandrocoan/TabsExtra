            "text": "User Guide\n\n\nConfiguration and usage of TabsExtra.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Usage\n\n\nUsing TabsExtra is very straight forward once the menu is created.  TabsExtra will update the right click context menu of tabs with various useful features.  It also overrides a couple of Sublime\ns commands to allow for various improvements in relation to tab focus when closing files, tab position when opening files, and making available new useful close commands.\n\n\nInstall/Upgrade Menu\n\n\nWhen first installing TabsExtra, you need to Install the new menu; this does not happen automatically.  Go to \nPreferences-\nPackage Settings-\nTabsExtra\n and Install/Upgrade either the \nbasic\n tab menu or the \noverride\n menu. The \nbasic\n menu\ns commands won\nt be grouped together with the built-in options because of the way Sublime Text\ns menus are managed.  But the \noverride\n menu overrides the \nDefault\n Package\ns tab context menu for sane, clean grouping of the commands.\n\n\nWhich Commands does TabsExtra Override?\n\n\nTabsExtra does \nnot\n override \nclose_file\n, but it does override the following:\n\n\n\n\nclose_by_index\n: close view from tab\n\n\nclose\n: close active view from global menu\n\n\nclose_all\n: close all tabs in all groups\n\n\nclose_others_by_index\n: close other tabs in current group\n\n\nclose_to_right_by_index\n close tabs to right in current group\n\n\n\n\nWhat TabsExtra Cannot Do\n\n\nTabsExtra \ncannot\n override the tab close button.  But it should be able to predict when it is pressed, and focus the appropriate window after the close.\n\n\nSticky Tab Settings\n\n\nBy default, after any \nClose\n command is run, all \nSticky\n tab properties are forgotten.  You can make a tab\ns \nStickiness\n persist by enabling the following setting:\n\n\n    \npersistent_sticky\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTab Focus After Close\n\n\nBy default TabsExtra keeps the current active tab focused, but if the active tab gets deleted, TabsExtra will default to either the left, right, or last active tab (depending how the user has it set).\n\n\n    \n// If active window gets closed, default to (left|right|last_active)\n\n    \nfallback_focus\n:\n \nright\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTab Spawn Position\n\n\nTabsExtra can control where a new window is opened with the \nspawn_view\n settings option.\n\n\n    \n// Experimental: When opening a view, where should it be spawned at (none|left|active_left|active_right|right)\n\n    \nspawn_view\n:\n \nnone\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTab Sort\n\n\nTabsExtra adds various sort options to the tab context menu.  You can control which sort options appear and even configure a specific sort command to run when a file is saved in the settings file.  You can also adjust how numbers in strings are sorted.\n\n\n    \n// Define sort layout.  Each entry contains:\n\n    \n//    \nmodule\n: plugin that defines what view meta data is used to sort\n\n    \n//    \ncaption\n: menu name for entry\n\n    \n//    \nreverse\n: (optional) sort tabs in the reverse (true|false)\n\n    \nsort_layout\n:\n \n[\n\n        \n{\nmodule\n:\n \nTabsExtra.sort.name\n,\n \ncaption\n:\n \nName\n},\n\n        \n{\nmodule\n:\n \nTabsExtra.sort.path\n,\n \ncaption\n:\n \nPath\n},\n\n        \n{\nmodule\n:\n \nTabsExtra.sort.modified\n,\n \ncaption\n:\n \nModified\n},\n\n        \n{\nmodule\n:\n \nTabsExtra.sort.created\n,\n \ncaption\n:\n \nCreated\n},\n\n        \n{\nmodule\n:\n \nTabsExtra.sort.type\n,\n \ncaption\n:\n \nExtension\n},\n\n        \n{\nmodule\n:\n \nTabsExtra.sort.size\n,\n \ncaption\n:\n \nSize\n},\n\n        \n{\nmodule\n:\n \nTabsExtra.sort.activated\n,\n \ncaption\n:\n \nLast Activated\n},\n\n        \n{\nmodule\n:\n \nTabsExtra.sort.syntax\n,\n \ncaption\n:\n \nSyntax\n},\n\n        \n{\nmodule\n:\n \nTabsExtra.sort.reverse\n,\n \ncaption\n:\n \nReverse Order\n}\n\n    \n],\n\n    \n// When sorting, normal strings will be sorted numerically.\n\n    \n//\n\n    \n// Example (non-numerical sort):\n\n    \n//   test12 test2 test1 =\n test1 test12 test2\n\n    \n//\n\n    \n// Example (numerical sort):\n\n    \n//   test12 test2 test1 =\n test1 test2 test12\n\n    \nnumeric_sort\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n    \n// Sort tabs when a file is opened or saved\n\n    \nsort_on_load_save\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n    \n// Sort module to use when sorting on load and save\n\n    \n//    \nmodule\n: plugin that defines what view meta data is used to sort\n\n    \n//    \nreverse\n: (optional) sort tabs in the reverse (true|false)\n\n    \nsort_on_load_save_command\n:\n \n{\nmodule\n:\n \nTabsExtra.sort.name\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSort options are actually provided by small sort modules.  As seen above, sort modules are specified in the settings file like you are importing a python module.  The package folder would be the root of the module and would then be followed by the sub-folders and the actual module name; all would be separated with dots.  As shown above, TabsExtra comes with 9 different sort modules: name, path, modified, created, type, size, activated, syntax, reverse.  If these modules do not suit your needs, you can right your own.\n\n\nWithin a sort module, there must be a run method as shown above below:\n\n\n\n\ndef run(views, view_data)\n\n\n\n\nThis function takes a list of \nviews\n and an empty list to append sort data to.  The \nview_data\n is populated by the \nrun\n function with arrays of formatted info that will be used to sort the tabs.  Info with the most importance should be appended first.\n\n\nIf you are dealing with strings that have numbers, and you wish to sort them numerically, you can import the numeric helper with the following import: \nfrom\n \nTabsExtra\n \nimport\n \ntab_sort_helper\n \nas\n \ntsh\n.  Once imported you can simply run your data through the \ntab_sort_helper\n: \ntsh\n.\nnumeric_sort\n(\ndirname\n(\nv\n.\nfile_name\n()\n \nif\n \nv\n.\nfile_name\n()\n \nelse\n \n)\n.\n\n\nParameters\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nviews\n\n\nList of Sublime view objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nview_data\n\n\nAn empty list that should be populated by the function with relevant sort data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample module:\n\n\nfrom\n \nos.path\n \nimport\n \ndirname\n,\n \nbasename\n\n\nfrom\n \nTabsExtra\n \nimport\n \ntab_sort_helper\n \nas\n \ntsh\n\n\n\n\ndef\n \nrun\n(\nviews\n,\n \nview_data\n):\n\n    \nfor\n \nv\n \nin\n \nviews\n:\n\n        \nview_data\n.\nappend\n(\n\n            \n(\n\n                \ntsh\n.\nnumeric_sort\n(\ndirname\n(\nv\n.\nfile_name\n()\n \nif\n \nv\n.\nfile_name\n()\n \nelse\n \n)\n.\nlower\n()),\n\n                \ntsh\n.\nnumeric_sort\n(\nbasename\n(\nv\n.\nfile_name\n()\n \nif\n \nv\n.\nfile_name\n()\n \nelse\n \n)\n.\nlower\n()),\n\n                \nv\n\n            \n)\n\n        \n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Menu Helper Commands\n\n\nTabsExtra also adds a number of other miscellaneous useful tab context commands that can open recently tabs, delete tabs from the disk, rename the current file, reveal the the tab\ns file in the sidebar or file manager, retrieve the file path, and revert unsaved changes.\n\n\nCustomize Tab Context Menu\n\n\nThe tab menu adds a number of times.  Each item group can be re-ordered, or excluded if desired via the settings file.\n\n\n    \n// Menu layout include or exclude, in whatever order you desire, the following options:\n\n    \n// [\nclose\n, \nsticky\n, \nopen\n, \nclone\n, \nsave\n, \ndelete\n, \nrename\n, \nreveal\n, \npath\n, \nrevert\n, \nsort\n]\n\n    \n// When done, go to Preferences-\nPackage Settings-\nTabsExtra and Install/Upgrade either\n\n    \n// the default TabsMenu or the Override Menu which overrides the \nDefault\n package\ns menu.\n\n    \nmenu_layout\n:\n \n[\nclose\n,\n \nsticky\n,\n \nopen\n,\n \nclone\n,\n \nsave\n,\n \ndelete\n,\n \nrename\n,\n \nreveal\n,\n \npath\n,\n \nrevert\n,\n \nsort\n],",

You can install nose via:\n\n\npip install nose\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tests should be run from the root folder of the plugin by using the following command:\n\n\nnosetests .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinting is performed on the entire project with \nflake8\n, \nflake8_docstrings\n, \npep8-naming\n.  These can be installed via:\n\n\npip install flake8\npip install flake8_docstrings\npip install pep8-naming\n\n\n\n\n\nLinting is performed with the following command:\n\n\nflake8 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation Improvements\n\n\nA ton of time has been spent not only creating and supporting this plugin, but also spent making this documentation.  If you feel it is still lacking, show your appreciation for the plugin by helping to improve the documentation.  Help with documentation is always appreciated and can be done via pull requests.  There shouldn\nt be any need to run validation tests if only updating documentation.\n\n\nYou don\nt have to render the docs locally before pull requesting, but if you wish to, I currently use a combination of \nmkdocs\n with my own custom Python Markdown \nextensions\n to render the docs.  You can preview the docs if you install these two packages.  The command for previewing the docs is \nmkdocs serve\n from the root directory.",
